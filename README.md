## Technologies
Built with JavaScript, HTML & CSS

## Macro view
A canvas containing a grid of squares will be displayed upon opening the page, with 2 buttons below it: 'New Sketch' and 'Clear Canvas'.

When the user clicks 'New Sketch', a prompt will display asking the user how many squares on each side of the canvas there should be (max 100). Upon submitting a valid number, a new empty square canvas will be displayed with the requested size. 

As the user moves their cursor across the canvas, each square the user hovers over will change color when the cursor starts hovering over it. 

Pressing the 'Clear Canvas' button will trigger a confirmation dialog, which if approved will clear the canvas and return the app to its initial state.
